====================

This repo contains the code for the research "The influence of amplifier settings on the perception of ’heaviness’ in guitar timbre".

Just Noticeable Difference pre-experiment is carried out using the software Reaper. The scripts for randomly generating test audios, and for generating final 1000 audios with different parameters are in the PythonScript folder.  (Reaper only support Python3.1 and above version)

Web Based Listening experiment is carried out via a website, designed in Django (Django web framework needs Python version under 3.0, e.g. Python2.6 or Python2.7). 

Final data and analysis are in the MatlabScript folder.
